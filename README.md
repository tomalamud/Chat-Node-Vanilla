# Sockets from the native "Net" module.

As a personal challenge, I have been created this simple chat with the native "Net" module which come with Node.js

You can just clone it and run every file as:
 
 ```bash
 node server.js
 ```
 
and in other two terminals:

```bash
 node client.js
```

That's all. You will be able to send messages between your two clients while the server is watching the communication.
